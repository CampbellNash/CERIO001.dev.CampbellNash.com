                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>uses secure, reliable cloud-hosting technology from Microsoft. This means that you don’t need to install any additional hardware or software – no need to make work for the IT department. The system creates a Chinese wall between internal and external (supplier) users to ensure privacy. External users access the system using their own login credentials via the internet. They don’t need to access any of your company systems or have a company account to complete the questionnaire.</p>
